## Introduction
Face recognition is a critical technology in various applications, including security, surveillance, and personal device access. This project focuses on developing a robust face recognition model using the VGG16 architecture with transfer learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled images of faces. Ensure that the dataset is organized in the following structure:
Replace `dataset/`, `train/`, and `test/` with your actual dataset paths.

## Model Architecture
The VGG16 model is used as the base model, and a custom classifier is added on top for face recognition. The model leverages the pre-trained weights of VGG16 on the ImageNet dataset for feature extraction, followed by training the top layers for our specific task.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-vgg16.git
    cd face-recognition-vgg16
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Alternatively, you can run the entire process on Google Colab by accessing the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w09lQyiptANJKKPz24H8PvK6iMuhDKcY?usp=drive_link).

## Results
After training, the model achieves high accuracy in recognizing faces. The performance metrics and visualizations can be found in the results directory.
